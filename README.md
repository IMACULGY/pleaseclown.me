# pleaseclown.me
An API that returns random clown sounds (WIP)

## How to use
**api.pleaseclown.me**

By default, the API returns a random sound effect in the MP3 format.
To change the format, include `?format=<format>` at the end of the URL. Supported file formats are .mp3, with future support for .wav, .ogg, and .flac file types.

This README will be updated when more features are added to the API.
